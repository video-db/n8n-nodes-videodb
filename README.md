## Development

To streamline and accelerate the development process, follow these steps:

1. Install _n8n_ globally (`npm add -g n8n`).
2. Set the `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS` environment variable to the `/dist` directory of this repository.
3. Enable hot reloading by setting the `N8N_DEV_RELOAD` environment variable to `true`.
4. Run `npm run dev` to watch for changes and automatically rebuild the node as you develop.
5. Start n8n with `n8n start` to launch the editor UI.
6. Open the n8n editor UI in your browser.

You should now be able to search for and use the VideoDB node in your n8n workflows.

> **Note:** When launching n8n locally for the first time, you will be prompted to create a user account. If you forget your credentials, you can reset n8n to its initial state by running `n8n user-management:reset`.
